  This is my CP2 website. It is a classic matching game. The theme is foods.
  The user clicks on cards, tries to match the food, and gets a celebration when
  they clear the board!

        <h1>Bella's Movie Recs</h1>
        <p>
        Hi, I'm Bella and I've seen quite a few movies. Thus, I have developed some pretty
        strong movie opinions. So, if you want to watch a movie, but aren't sure where to start,
        rather than scrolling for 20 minutes through hundreds movies, here's a narrowed down
        list of my personal recommendations. Enjoy!
